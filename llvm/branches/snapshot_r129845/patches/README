==============================
         Patch
==============================

This directory contains patches to add the AVR back-end to the build-scripts of 
the LLVM trunk.

To apply all patches execute the following line in the LLVM trunk:

 ~/llvm/trunk$ cat /TO/AVR-LLVM/TRUNK/patches/*.diff | patch -p0

==============================
         Replace
==============================

Autogenerated files are not supplied as patches. If you don't
want to generate them by yourselve copy the files from the 
'replace' directory to the LLVM trunk. You can use rsync to do so.

 $ rsync -r --exclude=.svn /TO/AVR-LLVM/TRUNK/patches/replace/* ~/llvm/trunk

Note: do not use 'cp -rf' if you are working on svn checkouts. 'cp' does not
have an --exclude option and will destroy the LLVM svn metainformation.
